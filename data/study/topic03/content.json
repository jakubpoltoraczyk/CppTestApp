"It's recommended to use 'std::array' instead of the basic C style array.
The 'std::array' container is available from the C++11 standard and provides
a convenient way to manage fixed size array in a harmony with modern C++
programming style.",
"Instead of creating a dynamically allocated C style array it's
better to use the 'std::vector' container. It takes the responsibility
for memory deallocation and provides many functionalities to work with
modern C++ features."]
